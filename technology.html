    <h3>ERT 300 Tenniscomputer</h3>
    <p>We also use the <a href="https://ert300.com" target="_blank">ERT 300</a> to measure Dynamic Tension (DT) — the actual stringbed stiffness — both before and after stringing. This high-precision device gives players valuable feedback on their racket’s tension over time and helps track string performance. DT readings allow for more informed decisions on when to restring based on real data.</p>
